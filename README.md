# My First Flutter Project

Welcome to my very first Flutter project! 

This project is **purely for learning purposes**. I'm using it to become more familiar with:

- Creating and organizing Flutter projects
- Understanding basic Flutter widgets and app structure
- Learning how to use Git and GitHub to manage and share code

---

## What This Project Includes

- A simple Flutter ID app (starter template or custom beginner UI)
- Basic usage of widgets, layouts, and navigation
- Version control using Git
- Hosted on GitHub for practice and portfolio building
